# Grid

The grid component is a layout component that arranges its children in a grid layout. It supports both fixed and fluid layouts.

It has a `display: grid` style by default.

## How to use

```tsx
import { Box, Grid } from '@devup-ui/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <Grid>
      <Box bg="blue" h={25} w={25} />
      <Box bg="blue" h={25} w={25} />
      <Box bg="blue" h={25} w={25} />
    </Grid>
  )
}
```

The Grid component defined above will render like this:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="a-d">
      <div className="aa ab ac"></div>
      <div className="aa ab ac"></div>
      <div className="aa ab ac"></div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```css
.aa {
  background: blue;
}
.ab {
  height: 100px;
}
.ac {
  width: 100px;
}
.a-d {
  display: grid;
}
```

If you pass a number without a unit to a style property, it will be automatically scaled by 4.
This means 1 equals 4px, 2 equals 8px, and so on.

Class names and style properties are resolved in the following order:

1. Generate class names for child components.
   - Compute class names and style properties coming from each child (including component defaults, utility classes, and props).

2. Remove duplicate component properties.
   - Deduplicate only when both the `key:value` pair and the `style-order` match.

3. If the key:value matches but the `style-order` differs, the property is not removed — the later/higher-priority style will take precedence.
   - Example: In other words, the `display: flex` implemented internally by `Center` and the `display: flex` provided directly by the user have different style-orders, so they are not removed, and the final style is applied according to priority.

4. Generate the parent component’s className based on the merged result.
   - After child classNames are generated and duplicates (per rules above) removed, compute/merge the parent className and final style output.

# css

`css` function is a function that returns a string.

## How to use

### CSS Literal

You can use `css` as a tag function to create a css string. Pass in a string of css properties as an argument, ans it will be converted
into a class list.

```typescript
const before = (
  <div
    className={css`
      color: red;
    `}
  />
)

const after = <any className="d0"/>

```

### CSS Object

You can also use the css function by passing in a css object as an argument.

```typescript
const before = (
  <any
    className={css({
      color: 'red',
    })}
  />
)

const after = <any className="d0" />
```

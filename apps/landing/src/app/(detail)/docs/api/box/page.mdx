# Box

The `Box` component is a layout primitive that can be used to create any kind of layout.

It is just a `div` with some styles.

## How to use

```typescript
const before = <Box bg={"red"} />

const after = <div className="d0" />
```

You can use the `as` prop to change the element type.

```typescript
const before = <Box as={"span"} />

const after = <span className="d0" />
```

# No Dependencies

Devup UI converts pure React source code without additional UI runtime code.

This section explains what “No Dependencies” means in practice, why it matters, and how Devup UI achieves it without requiring client-side style engines, extra plugins, or manual pre-generation steps.

## Motivation

- Many CSS-in-JS libraries rely on JavaScript at runtime to compute styles, inject `<style>` tags, or resolve variables.
- When dynamic values (e.g., variables, expressions) are used, these solutions often fall back to runtime dependencies—a partial solution that reintroduces costs.
- In frameworks like Next.js, such runtime-style systems frequently cannot be used inside RSC (React Server Components).

We asked: Can we deliver truly zero-runtime CSS that also works in RSC—without extra UI runtime code?

Our approach is grounded in static analysis. Once code is built and shipped, it should contain the definitive answer—no further computation required on the client.

## What “No Dependencies” Means

- No UI runtime code is added to your bundle for styling.
- No extra plugins, pre-generation scripts, or PostCSS configs are required.
- Pure React remains your source of truth; styles are compiled at build time into static CSS.
- Works in RSC and the edge/runtime contexts where client-side style engines are unavailable or undesired.

## How It Works?

1. Parse your React source into an AST using Rust-based tooling.
2. Perform static analysis to extract all style semantics from components and props.
3. Resolve and de-duplicate styles, generating compact, atomic class names.
4. Emit a new AST with class names applied and a CSS virtual file populated with the minimal rule set.
5. Bundle emits static CSS and class-applied markup—no client-side style engine.

## Compatibility

- Next.js (including RSC): Safe to use without runtime style engines.
- Vite, Rsbuild, Webpack: Supported via official plugins.
- Works with server-first and edge contexts that restrict DOM/JS-based style injection.

## Class Naming Policy

- Class names never start with a digit (to satisfy CSS constraints).
- We minimize class name length while maintaining safety.
  For example, tokens like `ad` may be flagged by content blockers; we emit `a-d` instead to break filter matches.
- To avoid common ad-blocker heuristics (e.g., EasyList-style rules), we segment suspicious tokens by inserting a hyphen while keeping names compact.
- Example mappings:
  - `ad` → `a-d`
  - `ads` → `a-ds`
  - `adbanner` → `a-dbanner`
  - `ad_top` → `a-d_top`
- Generation is deterministic: the same input always yields the same safe class name across builds.
- The policy does not depend on any specific filter list and typically remains robust as lists evolve.
- Scope: applied to Devup UI–generated atomic class tokens only; user-supplied `className` strings are not rewritten.
- Allowed characters include `a`–`z`, combinations like `az`, `a0`, and safe hyphen/underscore placements.

## Advantages if Using

Devup UI brings the convenience of CSS-in-JS together with the performance of static CSS—delivering the best of both worlds with no extra UI runtime dependencies.

1. **Zero runtime**: All styles are compiled to static CSS at build time.
2. **De-duplication**: Identical styles are generated once and reused globally.
3. **Performance**: Rust-powered pipeline provides fast, scalable builds.
4. **Smaller bundles**: No redundant classes, no UI runtime styling code.

# Type Inference System

Devup UI automatically infers TypeScript types for CSS properties, ensuring type safety and a smooth developer experience — no manual definitions required.
Unlike traditional CSS-in-JS libraries, Devup UI **derives types directly from CSS standards**.

## How It Works

The type inference process consists of four main steps:

1. **Parsing** – analyzes JSX/TSX code
2. **Property Lookup** – checks against the CSS property map
3. **Type Generation** – produces corresponding TypeScript types
4. **Validation** – enforces compile-time correctness

### 1. CSS Property Mapping

All CSS properties are defined in a Rust-based mapping table.

```rust
pub(super) static GLOBAL_STYLE_PROPERTY: phf::Map<&str, &[&str]> = phf_map! {
    "bg" => &["background"],
    "bgColor" => &["background-color"],
    "m" => &["margin"],
    "w" => &["width"],
    "h" => &["height"],
    // ...
};

```

### 2. Type Generation

TypeScript types are automatically derived from CSS property names and value patterns.

It supports various value types — such as lengths, colors, and percentages — and

ensures **type-safe responsive arrays** for breakpoint-based styles.

```tsx
<Box w={[100, 200, 300]} />
```

### 3. Special Property Handling

Certain properties are excluded from inference, such as React-specific or HTML attributes.

```rust
static SPECIAL_PROPERTIES: phf::Set<&str> = phf_set! {
    "children", "ref", "key", "className", "id", "style",
};

```

## Advantages

Devup UI’s type inference system provides several key benefits:

- **Automatic updates** – New CSS properties are supported immediately when standards evolve, without requiring library updates.
- **Type safety** – All properties and values are strictly typed, preventing invalid or misspelled declarations at compile time.
- **Extensibility** – Experimental or custom CSS features can be easily extended within the system.

This type inference system is automatic, reliable, and future-ready, allowing developers to focus on design and logic rather than manual type management.

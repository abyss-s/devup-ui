# Type Inference System

Devup UI automatically infers TypeScript types for CSS properties, ensuring type safety and a smooth developer experience — no manual definitions required.
Unlike traditional CSS-in-JS libraries, Devup UI **derives types directly from CSS standards**.

## How It Works

Devup UI uses the **csstype** package to automatically generate types for CSS properties. Instead of manually defining types, Devup UI reads the standard CSS definitions from csstype and uses them directly.

### 1. Reading CSS Standards

Devup UI reads all CSS property definitions from the **csstype** package, which contains the official CSS standards. This includes both regular properties (like `width`, `color`) and shorthand properties (like `margin`, `padding`).

### 2. Auto-Converting Selectors

When you use CSS states like `:hover` or `:focus`, Devup UI automatically converts them into props you can use. For example, `:hover` becomes `_hover` so you can write `<Box _hover={{ bg: 'red' }} />`.

When `csstype` is updated with new CSS standards, Devup UI automatically gets these updates without needing a library update.

### 3. Catching Mistakes Early

TypeScript checks your CSS properties while you're coding. If you try to use an invalid property or value, you'll get an error right away instead of discovering it later.

## Advantages

Devup UI's type inference system provides several key benefits:

- **Automatic updates** – New CSS properties are supported immediately when the csstype package is updated. Simply update the package without requiring devup-ui library updates.
- **Type safety** – All properties and values are strictly typed based on CSS standards, preventing invalid or misspelled declarations at compile time.
- **Standards compliance** – Types are always aligned with official CSS specifications, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all CSS standards.

This type inference system is automatic, reliable, and future-ready, allowing developers to focus on design and logic rather than manual type management.

# Zero Runtime

Devup UI is a CSS-in-JS preprocessor that requires no runtime. By moving style computation to build time, Devup UI avoids browser runtime overhead. We are building a preprocessor that accounts for all syntactic cases.

## End-to-end Process

### 1. **Source Code Input**

Your application code written in JSX/TSX/JS/TS is provided as input.

For example, consider the following `<Button>` component.

```tsx
<Button
  _hover={{ bg: 'red' }}
  bg="blue"
  className="btn"
  color="white"
  fontSize={['10px', null, null, '16px']}
>
  Click me!
</Button>
```

### 2. **AST Transformation (Rust + oxc)**

We use **oxc** (a Rust-based JavaScript tooling suite) to convert code into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

- **Lexer**: breaks source code into tokens
- **Parser**: structures tokens into an AST

This step is required to enable optimizations performed later by the **Style Storage**.

### **3. Style Caching Logic (Core logic)**

Core logic written in Rust + WebAssembly optimizes styles by consulting the Style Storage: **Style Storage Check**

- **Existing style?** → Reuse the existing class name (cached result)
- **New style?** → Generate a new class and register it

### **4. Code Generation Paths**

Based on the caching results in step 3, two parallel outputs are produced.

- **New AST**
  - Generate a new AST in TypeScript
  - Inject resolved style class names

- **Update CSS Virtual File**
  - Append newly generated style classes to the CSS virtual file
  - Do not regenerate existing styles

### **5. Final Output**

The bundler (Vite, Rsbuild, Next.js, Webpack) emits optimized code.

```html
<button className="btn a b c d e">Click me!</button>
```

Inline style props are compiled into **atomic CSS classes**, achieving zero runtime.

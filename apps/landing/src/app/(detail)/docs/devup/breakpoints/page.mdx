# Breakpoints

You can add responsive design by using an array of maximum 6 elements. The viewport ranges of each style
value in the array are listed below:

- 1st element: ~ 479px,
- 2nd element: 480px ~ 767px,
- 3rd element: 768px ~ 991px,
- 4th element: 992px ~ 1279px,
- 5th element: 1280px ~ 1599px,
- 6th element : 1600px ~

## How to use

```tsx
const box = (
  <Box
    bg={['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple', 'orange']}
    h={25}
    w={25}
  >
    <Text>Hello</Text>
  </Box>
)
```

If any of the five elements are set to `null`, Devup UI uses the previous value for responsive design.
For example, if the array in the example above is changed into `['red', null, 'green', null, 'purple']`,
the background color of `Box` component will be red from 0px to 767px, green from 768px to 1279px, purple from 1280px.

If the length of the array is less than 5, Devup UI makes responsive design according to the index of the element.
